# Report SuperPy


The SuperPy project stands as a versatile command-line tool meticulously crafted to streamline inventory management for a major supermarket chain. Offering an array of functionalities, it empowers users to effortlessly monitor and report on various aspects of the supermarket's product inventory. From facilitating product transactions to generating detailed inventory reports and managing time-based scenarios, SuperPy is designed to be the supermarket's ultimate inventory companion.

At the core of SuperPy's functionality lies its prowess in handling product information through CSV files.

This structured approach to data storage ensures seamless data management and retrieval, contributing to the tool's efficiency.

A standout feature of SuperPy is its time manipulation capability. Leveraging the --advance-time option, users can seamlessly simulate the passage of time by specifying the number of days to advance. This temporal manipulation proves invaluable for testing and simulating diverse scenarios within the supermarket's dynamic inventory management system.

Implemented through the argparse module, the command-line interface of SuperPy is both intuitive and user-friendly. Detailed help messages and robust error handling contribute to a smooth and error-free user experience.

SuperPy not only excels in transactional operations but also in its robust reporting capabilities. Users can effortlessly generate insightful inventory reports, revenue reports, and profit reports. The inventory reports furnish comprehensive product information, including name, count, buy price, and expiration date. Revenue reports offer detailed insights into daily and historical revenue, while profit reports meticulously calculate profits over a given period.

In conclusion, SuperPy stands as an all-encompassing command-line tool, providing seamless inventory management functionality for a large supermarket chain. With its dynamic features, users can efficiently track product information, manage inventory levels, and generate detailed reports.
